    "### 1. Describe and explain what each of these expressions produces in basic Python:\n",
    "a) 2+5\n",
    "<br>This expression indicates two plus five, and basic Python would produce an output of 7.\n",
    "<br>b) 2 + 5\n",
    "<br>This expression also indicates two plus five because white spaces are ignored in Python, so Python would still produce an output of 7.\n",
    "<br>c) 2*5\n",
    "<br>This expression indicates two times five, and basic Python would produce an output of 10.\n",
    "<br>d) 2/5\n",
    "<br>This expression indicates two divided by five, and basic Python would produce a float output of 0.4.\n",
    "<br>e) 2**5\n",
    "<br>This expression indicates two to the fifth power, and basic Python would produce an output of 32.\n",

    "### 2. What is the value of x after running these statements in order? Why?\n",
    "##### a) x = 7\n",
    "Value of x is 7 after running this statement because it assigns 7 to x.\n",
    "##### b) x = x + 3\n",
    "Value of x is 10 after running this statement because it assigns the sum of original value of x and 3 to x, which is 7 + 3 = 10.\n",

    "y = x\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "`\n",
    "<br>After running these statements in order, value of y is 3 and value of x is 10. y does not become 10 because Python does not establish connections among variables or automatically update one variable's value based on its relationship with another. Therefore, y stays 3. x is 10 because it is assigned a value of 10 in the third line.\n",

    "### 15. Explain each line:\n",
    "`len([1234])` This line produces `1` because the list only contains one item, which is `1234`.\n",
    "<br>`len(\"1234\")` This line produces `4` because the string `\"1234\"` contains 4 characters.\n",
    "<br>`len(1234)` This line produces an error because an integer has no length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What are the type and length of x = []?\n",
    "Since x is an empty list, its type is `list` and its length is 0.\n",
